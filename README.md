# Day 3 – JavaScript Practice Tasks

This repository contains my third day JavaScript practice programs.
These tasks focus on loops, arrays, and iteration techniques in JavaScript.

## Topics Covered

* for loop
* Array basics
* Iteration
* Number patterns
* Logical problem solving

## Programs Included

### 1. Reversed Array

This program reverses the elements of an array.

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

This helped me understand array indexing and loop iteration.

---

### 2. Multiplication Tables (1–10)

This program prints multiplication tables from 1 to 10 using loops.

Example:
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
...
2 x 10 = 20

This helped me practice nested loops and number patterns.

---

### 3. Sum of Even Numbers (1–100)

This program calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

It checks whether a number is even and adds it to the total sum.

This helped me understand conditions inside loops.

## What I Learned

* Working with loops in JavaScript
* Iterating through arrays
* Nested loops
* Writing logical programs step by step

This is my Day-3 progress in learning JavaScript
